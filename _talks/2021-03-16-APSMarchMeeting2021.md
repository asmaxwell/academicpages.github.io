We present the first derivation of quantum and classical Fisher information for attoscience to characterize the laser intensity uncertainty for in situ measurements in strong field ionization.  We demonstrate that interference effects greatly reduce the laser intensity uncertainty and suggest how to minimize uncertainties in a previous experiment.
