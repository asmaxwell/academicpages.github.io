Motivated by advances in electron vortex states, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), we exploit conserved helicity inherent in photoelectrons carrying OAM from a chiral target to propose a new ultrafast chiral imaging technique, dubbed photoelectron vortex dichroism (PEVD). We theoretically demonstrate huge asymmetry in OAM-resolved photoelectron emission, sensitive to molecular chirality, for electrons ionized by strong linearly polarized fields.
