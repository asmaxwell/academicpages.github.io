Summary and Impact of Research
-------------------------------
My research history is as follows:
My PhD focused on quantum interference in strong-field processes,
directly resulted in 7 first author publications, including one in
Phys. Rev. Lett. Following my PhD I was invited to
Instituto de Ciencias Fotónicas (ICFO) in Barcelona,
Spain for two weeks and the Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics (WIPM) in China for a month to collaborate.
I went on to do a two-year Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded fellowship at the University
College London (UCL) quantum science and technology institute (UCLQ),
investigating quantum metrology and previously neglected quantum effects
in strong field systems.
From November  2020 until September 2021 I did a postdoc at the Instituto de Ciencias Fotónicas (ICFO) in Barcelona, researching entanglement and quantum simulators in strong field systems.
From 2021, I was awarded a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship at Aarhus University in Denmark, focused on developing ionization models for electronic spin and orbital angular momentum in attoscience. My postdocs have resulted in 30 total publication, 8 first author and 3 senior author publications.
