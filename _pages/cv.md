Summary and Impact of Research
==============================

My PhD focused on quantum interference in strong-field processes,
directly resulted in 7 first author publications, including one in
Phys. Rev. Lett. Following my PhD I was invited to
Instituto de Ciencias Fotónicas (ICFO) in Barcelona,
Spain for two weeks and the Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics (WIPM) in China for a month to collaborate. I am
currently doing a two-year Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded fellowship at the University
College London (UCL) quantum science and technology institute (UCLQ),
investigating previously neglected quantum effects such as entanglement
in strong field systems.
