I am a Marie Curie Individual Fellow at Aarhus University investigating spin and orbital angular momentum in strong field systems,  [Aarhus Homepage](https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/andrew-maxwell(2cc779f0-ebc1-4c1a-8ddc-de305916e54f).html).
Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at University College London with an EPSRC fellowship in the quantum science and technology institute (UCLQ), where I worked on quantum metrology in attoscience as well as photoelectron holography. After that I worked at ICFO-The Institute of Photonic Sciences investigating entanglement in orbital angular momentum and chirality in attoscience.






News and Events
=================
See our recent work, recently accepted for publication by Physical Review Letters, [detecting chiral molecules](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201) by using the orbital angular momentum of photoelectrons ionized by strong laser fields.

We had some work published in Nature Communications demonstrating entanglement between two photoelectrons in non-sequential double ionization, by examining their orbital angular momentum using structured vortex states. [Check it out!](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32128-z)

A Plato style dialogue on analytical and ab initio methods for Quantum Battles in attoscience: [Eur. Phys. J. D (2021) 75: 209](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjd/s10053-021-00207-3).

Some recent papers we published on OAM in strong field physics 	[Faraday Discuss., 2021,228, 394-412](https://doi.org/10.1039/D0FD00105H) and [Eur. Phys. J. D (2021) 75: 199](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjd/s10053-021-00214-4).

<!---

I will be presenting a poster at this years virtual [ICPEAC conference](https://www.icpeac2021.ca/) on the work we have done on orbtial angular momentum in strong field ionization, which include interferences vortices, probing chirality and investigating entanglement.
I recently presented the [following](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/fd/d0fd00105h) work on twisted electron in strong field ionization at the Faraday discussion, which was held 1-3 February.
Reviewer of the month
------------------------------
I was listed as [reviewer of the month](https://www.nature.com/commsphys/referees/outstanding-referees) for October 2020 by the journal [Communication Physics Nature](https://www.nature.com/commsphys/)

Quantum Battles in Attoscience
------------------------------
I helped organise the fully online UCL based conference quantum battles in attoscience, which was held July 1-3. Check out the [website](https://www.quantumbattles.com/)
for more details. All the talks, including the battle I was involved in, are available on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBg-O7WZ8gZLBb6jTWn-McA/featured).
