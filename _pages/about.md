Quantum Battles in Attoscience
------------------------------
I helped organise the fully online UCL based conference quantum battles in attoscience, which was held July 1-3. Check out the [website](https://www.quantumbattles.com/)
for more details. All the talks, including the battle I was involved in, are available on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBg-O7WZ8gZLBb6jTWn-McA/featured).
