I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at ICFO-The Institute of Photonic Sciences investigating entanglement in orbital angular momentum and machine learning techniques in attoscience [ICFO Homepage](https://www.icfo.es/lang/about-icfo/people/people_details?people_id=1865).
Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at University College London with an EPSRC fellowship in the quantum science and technology institute (UCLQ), where I worked on quantum metrology in attoscience as well as photoelectron holography.






News and Events
=================

Check out our latest work on [metrology in strong field physics](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.103.043519), which I presented at the [APS March meeting](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR21/Session/F28.8).

I will be speaking at this years virtual [ICPEAC conference](https://www.icpeac2021.ca/) on the work we have done on orbtial angular momentum in strong field ionization, which include interferences vortices, probing chirality and investigating entanglement.

Check out our review on photoelectron holography [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6633/ab5c91).

I recently presented the [following](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/fd/d0fd00105h) work on twisted electron in strong field ionization at the Faraday discussion, which was held 1-3 February.
Reviewer of the month
------------------------------
I was listed as [reviewer of the month](https://www.nature.com/commsphys/referees/outstanding-referees) for October 2020 by the journal [Communication Physics Nature](https://www.nature.com/commsphys/)

Quantum Battles in Attoscience
------------------------------
I helped organise the fully online UCL based conference quantum battles in attoscience, which was held July 1-3. Check out the [website](https://www.quantumbattles.com/)
for more details. All the talks, including the battle I was involved in, are available on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBg-O7WZ8gZLBb6jTWn-McA/featured).
