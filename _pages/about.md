I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at ICFO-The Institue of Photonic Sciences investigating quantum aspects of attoscience [ICFO Homepage](https://www.icfo.es/lang/about-icfo/people/people_details?people_id=1865).
Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at University College London with an EPSRC fellowship in the quantum science and technology institute (UCLQ), where I worked on quantum metrology in attoscience as well as photoelectron holography.






News and Events
=================
I will be presenting the [following](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/fd/d0fd00105h) work on twisted electron in strong field ionizaiton at the Faraday discussion in February.

See our latest work on metrology in strong field physics [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10070.pdf).

Check out our review on photoelectron holography [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6633/ab5c91).

Reviewer of the month
------------------------------
I was listed as [reviewer of the month](https://www.nature.com/commsphys/referees/outstanding-referees) for October 2020 by the journal [Communication Physics Nature](https://www.nature.com/commsphys/)

Quantum Battles in Attoscience
------------------------------
I helped organise the fully online UCL based conference quantum battles in attoscience, which was held July 1-3. Check out the [website](https://www.quantumbattles.com/)
for more details. All the talks, including the battle I was involved in, are available on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBg-O7WZ8gZLBb6jTWn-McA/featured).
