Postdoctoral fellow at University College London with an EPSRC fellowship in the quantum science and technology institute (UCLQ) currently investigating previously neglected quantum effects such as entanglement in strong field systems. [UCL Home page](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=ASAMA74). From November I will start at postdoc at the Instituto de Ciencias Fotónicas (ICFO) in Barcelona and I was also recently awarded a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship to commence in 2021 at Aarhus University in Denmark.
